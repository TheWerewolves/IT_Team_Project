A question we see crop up fairly regularly is why we haven’t split TFT off into a separate game and instead keep it as a game mode within LoL. Doing so would give both experiences smaller download sizes, allow a cleaner UI, make it more obvious to newer players how they can get to the gameplay they want etc. Keeping both in the same client has some significant advantages though. The current approach gives development efficiencies when it comes to building code and content, both for TFT and for the MOBA side of LoL, meaning we can get more done than we otherwise could. There’s also a lot of player overlap between the two experiences, so easy movement back and forth between the two within a play session has some value too. Finally, while it would be a one time cost, splitting the two apart’s a decently sized project which is time that could be spent on developing or improving other features.

In the short term what we are looking at instead is ways to better meet the needs of both playerbases while maintaining the benefits of that proximity. That means things like separating out Ranked history for TFT, getting some dedicated news article etc space on the TFT hub, ensuring borders from TFT aren’t showing up in any SR queues and vice versa etc.
