I'm not really a minecraft player, had a dabble but the timesink wasn't really my thing. However after seeing Minecraft Dungeons and no longer playing Diablo III, it looks like it might scratch a particluar itch. I'm guessing the playerbase will be massive, although not sure if younger people will maybe be an obstacle in high end dungeon play?
