I used to play this game in ultra settings and with the same internet connection i have right now without any issue, many months ago. Now i'ts been about 15 days that i came back and the game is running always like this. I know that a lot of people have freezing and lagging issues, but this is completely unplayable. Is there any fix on that or i have to uninstall the game and play another one? Really i am so tired of this, i have it installed on my pc for no reason.
